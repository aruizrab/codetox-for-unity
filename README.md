# Codetox for Unity
Codetox is a general purpose script library to make your life easier, providing MonoBehaviour class extended functionalities, re-usable components and Editor scripts.

## Getting started
To start using **Codetox** in your Unity project go to your package manager, click on [add package from git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html "Unity Documentation - Installing from a Git URL"), and paste the following URL:
```
https://github.com/aruizrab/codetox-for-unity.git
```

## About
In every Unity project I work on I end up developing some functionalities to make the developing process easier. Codetox aims to gather all those functionalities in a single Unity package so I don't have to go through all my projects looking for *that one script* I made to use it somewhere else, and hopefully it will also be useful to any other Unity developers that stumble upon this repository :D

## Features
* [MonoBehaviour extended functionalities](../../wiki/MonoBehaviour-extended-functionalities)
